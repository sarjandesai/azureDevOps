# End-to-End Deployment with AKS and APIM

This repository contains the necessary steps to deploy an end-to-end solution using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure API Management (APIM).

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
2. **Azure CLI**: Install the Azure CLI on your local machine.
3. **Docker**: Familiarize yourself with Docker and containerization concepts.
4. **Kubernetes**: Basic understanding of Kubernetes and YAML manifests.

## Steps

1. **Create an AKS Cluster**:
   - Use ARM templates or Azure CLI to create an AKS cluster.
   - Customize the template to define your desired AKS infrastructure.

2. **Deploy Microservices to AKS**:
   - Package your microservices into Docker containers.
   - Deploy these containers to AKS using Kubernetes manifests (deployment, service, ingress).

3. **Set Up Azure API Management**:
   - Create an API Management instance in Azure.
   - Configure APIs within APIM (import from AKS or define manually).
   - Define policies for authentication, authorization, and other concerns.

4. **Integration Between AKS and APIM**:
   - Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication.
   - Configure APIM to route requests to AKS services.
   - Use APIM policies for transformations and rate limiting.

5. **Expose APIs via APIM**:
   - Publish your microservices as APIs through APIM.
   - Define API products, versions, and access control.
   - Set up developer portals for API discovery.

6. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Monitor AKS and APIM using Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
   - Analyze API usage, performance, and errors.
