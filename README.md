# End-to-End Azure Kubernetes Deployment with API Management using ARM Templates

This project demonstrates deploying a containerized API with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure API Management (APIM) using ARM templates.

## Project Overview

This approach offers an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution for managing your API deployment on Azure. ARM templates provide a declarative way to define your infrastructure resources.

## Prerequisites

- Azure Subscription
- Azure CLI or other deployment tools (e.g., Azure DevOps)
- Docker installed

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Develop and Containerize your API

- Develop your API application.
- Containerize your application using Docker.
- Push the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### 2. Define AKS Cluster with ARM Template

- Create an ARM template named `aks-cluster.json` to define the AKS cluster configuration.
- Include properties like resource group name, location, VM size, and network configuration.
- Consider using parameters for dynamic configuration during deployment (e.g., cluster name, number of nodes).

### 3. Deploy Containerized API to AKS with ARM Template

- Create another ARM template named `api-deployment.json` for deploying your containerized API to the AKS cluster.
- Reference the ACR containing your image and define deployment configurations like replicas, resources, and environment variables.

### 4. Configure API Management with ARM Template

- Design your API definition using OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) or Azure Policy.
- Create an ARM template named `apim-service.json` to deploy the APIM service with the desired pricing tier and location.
- Include the API definition file within the template to define the API in APIM.

### 5. Link API and APIM in ARM Template

- Configure a backend service pointing to your AKS deployment in the `apim-service.json` template.
- Use the AKS service type and reference the deployment name from the `api-deployment.json` template.

### 6. Deployment Script

- Combine the individual ARM templates (`aks-cluster.json`, `api-deployment.json`, `apim-service.json`) into a single deployment script or deploy them sequentially.
- Utilize Azure CLI, Azure DevOps pipelines, or other deployment tools to execute the script.
- The ARM templates will create the AKS cluster, deploy your containerized API, provision the APIM service, and link them together.

- Microsoft Quickstart - Create Azure API Management instance with ARM template: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.apimanagement/service
- ARM Template Reference for Microsoft.ApiManagement service: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.apimanagement/service
- Deploying a containerized application to AKS: https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/

## Important Notes

- This is a foundational guide. Each ARM template requires specific configurations for your API and environment.
- Secure your API with authentication and authorization policies within APIM.
- Consider using Azure Container Registry Tasks for automated image builds and deployments.

## Further Considerations

- Explore additional resources for in-depth configuration and security best practices for AKS and APIM deployments.
- Implement unit and integration tests for your API to ensure functionality.
- Monitor your API and AKS cluster for performance and health.

This project provides a starting point for deploying and managing your containerized APIs on Azure using ARM templates. By following these steps and leveraging the provided resources, you can establish a robust and automated deployment process for your Azure API.
